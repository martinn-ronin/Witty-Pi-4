# This script will be executed after Witty Pi receives shutdown command (GPIO-4 gets pulled down).
# If you want to run your commands before turnning of your Raspberry Pi, you can place them here.
# Raspberry Pi will not shutdown until all commands here are executed.

# Remarks: please use absolute path of the command, or it can not be found (by root user).
# Remarks: you may append '&' at the end of command to avoid blocking the main daemon.sh.
